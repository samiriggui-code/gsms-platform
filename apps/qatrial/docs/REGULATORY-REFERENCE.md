- Data migration validation
- Integration verification (Jira, GitHub, SSO)

### Compliance Statement

The Compliance Statement maps QAtrial features to three regulatory frameworks:

**21 CFR Part 11 -- Electronic Records and Electronic Signatures (15 sections):**
- 11.10(a) through 11.10(k) -- System validation, record protection, audit trail, access control, etc.
- 11.50 -- Signature manifestations
- 11.70 -- Signature/record linking
- 11.100 -- General requirements for electronic signatures
- 11.200 -- Electronic signature components and controls

**EU Annex 11 -- Computerised Systems (17 sections):**
- Sections 1-17 covering risk management, personnel, suppliers, data, accuracy checks, storage, printouts, audit trails, change management, incident management, electronic signatures, batch release, archiving, and business continuity

**GAMP 5 -- Category 4 (Configured Products):**
- Covers the risk-based approach, specification, configuration management, testing, and release

### Traceability Matrix

The Traceability Matrix maps **75 regulatory requirements** across 6 standards to:
- QAtrial features that implement or support each requirement
- IQ/OQ/PQ test step IDs that verify compliance
- Implementation status (Supported / Partial / Customer Responsibility)

Standards covered:
1. 21 CFR Part 11
2. EU Annex 11
3. GAMP 5
4. ISO 13485
5. ISO 14971
6. ICH Q10

## 6. Compliance Improvements

### Real Signature Verification

QAtrial implements proper identity-based electronic signatures:

- **Real user identity:** Signatures pull the authenticated user's name, role, and ID from `useAuthStore`, replacing placeholder values
- **Password re-authentication:** Users must re-enter their password at the point of signing, with a 15-minute validity window per 21 CFR Part 11.200(a)
- **Non-repudiation:** Each signature is bound to a verified user identity, supporting 21 CFR Part 11.70 non-repudiation requirements
- **Warning on unauthenticated signing:** The system warns when no user is logged in, preventing anonymous signatures

These improvements strengthen compliance with:
- 21 CFR Part 11 Subparts B and C (electronic signatures)
- EU Annex 11 Section 14 (electronic signatures)
- PMDA ER/ES Guidance (Japan)

### Audit Auto-Logging

All requirement and test CRUD operations automatically generate audit trail entries with the real user identity:

- **No manual logging required:** Create, update, delete, status change, link, and unlink operations are automatically captured
- **Real user attribution:** Every audit entry includes the authenticated user's name, role, and ID
- **New audit actions:** `ai_generate`, `ai_accept`, `ai_reject`, `login`, `logout`, and `import` are now tracked
- **AI provenance:** AI-generated artifacts are logged with the model, provider, and acceptance/rejection status

This addresses:
- 21 CFR Part 11.10(e) -- Audit trail requirement for electronic records
- EU Annex 11 Section 9 -- Audit trail for GMP-critical data changes
- FDA Data Integrity Guidance -- Attributable (who) requirement
- MHRA Data Integrity Guidance -- Data lifecycle management

### CAPA Lifecycle

The CAPA system implements a full lifecycle with formal status tracking:

```
open --> investigation --> in_progress --> verification --> resolved --> closed
```

Each status transition is logged in the audit trail. This structured lifecycle supports:
- 21 CFR 820.90 -- Medical device CAPA requirements (formal investigation and effectiveness verification)
- ISO 13485 Section 8.5.2/8.5.3 -- Corrective and preventive action with documented effectiveness
- ICH Q10 Section 3.2 -- CAPA as part of the pharmaceutical quality system
- EU GMP Chapter 1.4 -- Quality risk management and CAPA

### Advanced RBAC (5 Roles)

The 5-role RBAC model with granular permissions supports:

| Permission | Regulatory Basis |
|------------|-----------------|
| Segregation of duties (author vs. approver) | 21 CFR 11.10(d), EU Annex 11 Section 12 |
| Read-only auditor access | Audit and inspection access requirements |
| Reviewer role (approve without edit) | Approval workflow requirements per GxP |
| Admin-only configuration | System administration controls per 21 CFR 11.10(d) |

### Audit Mode (Read-Only Links)

The audit mode feature supports regulatory inspections by providing:
- Time-limited access (24h/72h/7d) aligned with typical audit durations
- No login required, reducing barriers for external auditors
- Complete read-only view of all compliance-relevant data
- Non-modifiable access that maintains data integrity during review

### Webhook Notifications

Webhook event dispatch supports quality system integration by:
- Providing real-time notifications of quality events (test failures, CAPA status changes, approvals)
- Supporting integration with external quality management systems
- HMAC signing ensures payload integrity and authenticity

### Aerospace Vertical References

The Aerospace vertical (`aerospace`) includes templates aligned with:
- **AS9100D** -- QMS requirements for aviation, space, and defense organizations
- **DO-178C** -- Software considerations in airborne systems and equipment certification
- **DO-254** -- Design assurance for airborne electronic hardware
- **EASA Part 21** -- European Aviation Safety Agency certification
- **FAR Part 21** -- FAA type and production certification
- **NADCAP** -- National Aerospace and Defense Contractors Accreditation

Risk taxonomy: FMEA with Design Assurance Level (DAL A-E) safety classification per DO-178C.

### Chemical / Environmental Vertical References

The Chemical / Environmental vertical (`chemical_env`) includes templates aligned with:
- **REACH (EC 1907/2006)** -- Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals
- **CLP Regulation (EC 1272/2008)** -- Classification, Labelling and Packaging of substances and mixtures
- **TSCA** -- US Toxic Substances Control Act
- **ISO 14001** -- Environmental Management Systems
- **ISO 45001** -- Occupational Health and Safety Management Systems
- **GHS** -- Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals

Risk taxonomy: FMEA for process and environmental risk assessment.
