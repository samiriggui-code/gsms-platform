**Self-hostable physical security risk assessment platform built on the CSMP methodology.**

Adversary/Action/Asset threat modelling, Inherent Risk Value (IRV) + Priority scoring, SHAPE/PPS countermeasures with ALARP justification, TEAR treatment strategies, and NIS2/CER/ISO 31000/ASIS SPC.1/ISO 28000 compliance tagging — in one open-source, API-first, single-tenant self-host platform.

Live demo: **https://demo.grace-ps.io/**

## Screenshots

### Dashboard — assessment posture at a glance

![Dashboard with assessment KPIs and recent activity](./docs/screenshots/dashboard.png)

### Asset tree — Site → Building → Floor → Room → Equipment hierarchy

58 assets across 3 sites. Each row shows asset type, coverage status, criticality (C1–C5), and edge count. Countermeasures appear inline next to the assets they protect.

![Asset tree showing 58 assets across Hamburg, Oslo, Warszawa HQ](./docs/screenshots/asset-tree.png)

### Asset relationships — typed graph

Site → Building → Floor → Room → Equipment hierarchy plus typed edges (DEPENDS_ON, PROTECTS, SERVES, CONTAINS, COMMUNICATES_WITH, ADJACENT_TO, SUPPLIES). Risk colour propagates along protective edges.

![Asset relationships graph with cluster groupings](./docs/screenshots/relationships.png)

### Site map — risk-coloured geographic pins

Leaflet view of every geocoded asset. Pin colour reflects current criticality so high-impact sites stand out at a glance.

### 7-step risk assessment wizard — Step 4, Impact

5-dimension impact rating (People · Property · Operations · Reputation · Financial) with composite = max-of-five and live IRV recompute. The 3-A threat model (Adversary × Action × Asset) is visible at the top.

![Wizard step 4 — Impact scoring with rationale field](./docs/screenshots/wizard-step4-impact.png)

### Surveys — field evidence capture

YES/PARTIAL/NO with weighted scoring, per-question comments, and per-asset breakdown. Survey rating (Strong / Baseline / Barely adequate / Inadequate) feeds the wizard's Step 5 Vulnerability rating.

![Survey run with per-asset breakdown and weighted questions](./docs/screenshots/survey-run.png)

### Assessments — review workflow

Per-row: scope (asset or cluster), evidence basis (Expert judgment / Survey-linked / Mixed), current wizard step, review state (PENDING → IN_REVIEW → APPROVED), threat count, top priority, lead.

![Assessments list with 9 demo assessments at various wizard steps and review states](./docs/screenshots/assessments-list.png)

### Approved assessment — executive summary

In-app cover view of a signed-off assessment: IRV distribution, treatment-priority distribution, top risks, action-plan progress, TEAR strategy mix, compliance-framework coverage, and protective-asset coverage.

### PDF report — analyst variant

Auto-generated PDF report (Puppeteer) — cover page + executive summary + per-threat detail. Branded GRACE Engine; methodology references CSMP 3-A in the footer line.

- **TEAR strategies** — Transfer / Eliminate / Accept / Reduce + ALARP rationale
- **Action plans** with compliance tags, owners, and target dates
- **Assessment snapshots** for review/approve/reject/manual-save audit trail
- **Asset catalogue** — Site → Building → Floor → Room → Equipment hierarchy, clusters, typed relationships
- **Site map** — Leaflet view of geocoded sites
- **Template Library** — Banking & Finance threat pack out-of-the-box, extensible
- **Review workflow** — PENDING → IN_REVIEW → APPROVED/REJECTED/REVISION_REQUESTED with snapshot hooks
- **PDF export** of approved assessments (Puppeteer)
- **REST API** with Swagger UI at `/api/docs`, JWT auth, per-role RBAC (Admin / Lead Assessor / Assessor / Reviewer / Stakeholder)

## Quick start (self-host)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/grace-pse/grace.git
cd grace
cp docker/.env.example docker/.env        # edit JWT_SECRET, POSTGRES_PASSWORD
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

Open **http://localhost:8080** and complete the one-time bootstrap form. The first user becomes the instance admin; the `/register` endpoint then 410s.

Want demo data? Load the Nordica scenario:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml exec api pnpm db:seed -- --reset
# Login: admin@nordica.demo / Demo123!
```

## Development

```bash
pnpm install
cp server/.env.example server/.env        # JWT_SECRET, DATABASE_URL
pnpm db:generate
pnpm db:migrate
pnpm dev                                  # api on :3001, web on :5173
```
