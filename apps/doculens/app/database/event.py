Event Database Model Module

This module defines the SQLAlchemy model for storing events in the database.
It provides two main storage components:
1. Raw event data (data column): Stores the original incoming event
2. Processing results (task_context column): Stores the pipeline processing results

This model is used with Alembic to generate the initial database migration.

    This model serves as the primary storage for both incoming events and
    their processing results. It uses JSONB columns for flexible schema
    storage of both raw data and processing context.

    Attributes:
        id: UUID primary key, auto-generated

        task_context: Results and metadata from pipeline processing
