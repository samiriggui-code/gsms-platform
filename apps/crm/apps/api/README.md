# `api`

NestJS API for the CRM. Runs on Bun, backed by `@crm/db` and `@crm/auth`.

## Running it

```sh
cp .env.example .env        # at the repo root — one file for the whole monorepo
openssl rand -base64 32     # -> NEXTAUTH_SECRET, same value as apps/app's

bun run dev                 # watch mode on http://localhost:3001
bun run test
bun run build && bun run start:prod
```

Three values are required and the process refuses to boot without them, naming
the one it is missing: `DATABASE_URL`, `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` and
`ALLOWED_SIGN_IN`. `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` must be the exact same value apps/app
signs session tokens with — this API only verifies them. `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`
and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` are the fourth value almost every install wants —
Gmail and Calendar sync, not sign-in (sign-in is email + password; see
apps/app's README). They are optional and set as a pair. The OAuth redirect
URI (`<APP_URL>/api/connections/google/callback`) is registered against
apps/app's origin, not this API's — that flow lives entirely in apps/app.
`src/config/env.validation.ts` is the full list of what this process reads;
[`docs/environment.md`](../../docs/environment.md) explains where the file is
found.

Bun is the runtime, not just the package manager: `@crm/db` and `@crm/auth`
ship TypeScript sources, so `tsc`/`node` cannot run this app directly. `tsc` is
used for type checking only (`bun run check-types`).

## Routes

| Route            | Auth       | Notes                                         |
| ---------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `/api/auth/*`    | anonymous  | Mounted by `@thallesp/nestjs-better-auth`     |
| `/auth/me`       | required   | Cached profile of the signed-in user          |
| `/auth/session`  | optional   | Whether the caller is signed in               |
| `/health`        | anonymous  | 200 with a database round-trip, 503 otherwise |
| `/internal/sync/google` | `CRON_SECRET` bearer | Vercel Cron entrypoint for Gmail/Calendar sync. Fails closed when the secret is unset. |

## How auth is wired

This process owns authentication. It mounts `/api/auth/*` and is the only one
that writes session cookies; the Next.js app in `apps/app` reads those sessions
straight from Postgres via `@crm/auth` and calls the routes above with
`credentials: "include"`.

`AuthModule.forRoot({ auth })` mounts the Better Auth handler and registers a
**global** `AuthGuard`, so every route is protected unless it opts out:

```ts
@Get('public')
@AllowAnonymous()          // no session required
@OptionalAuth()            // session optional; @Session() may be undefined
```

It also calls `enableCors({ origin: trustedOrigins, credentials: true })` for
the whole app, which is what lets the browser at `localhost:3000` talk to it —
`APP_URL` is the single knob for that, comma-separated if the app is served from
more than one origin.

`main.ts` creates the app with `bodyParser: false` — Better Auth needs the raw
request body, and the library installs its own parsers around the auth routes.

`AuthHooksService` uses `@AfterUpdate("user")` to drop a cached profile the
moment its row changes. Database hooks require `databaseHooks: {}` in the Better
Auth options and endpoint hooks require `hooks: {}` (both set in `@crm/auth`);
the library throws at startup without them.

## Caching

`AppCacheModule` registers `@nestjs/cache-manager` globally. It uses `REDIS_URL`
when set and otherwise falls back to a per-instance in-memory store — fine for
local development, not for more than one API instance.

`AuthService.getProfile` is the reference pattern: read through the cache, write
with an explicit TTL, invalidate on change.

## Notes

- Better Auth stores rate limits in the database (`rateLimit.storage`), so every
  request to `/api/auth/*` needs a reachable Postgres. Moving this to
  `secondaryStorage` backed by Redis would remove that dependency.
- Environment variables are validated at boot by `src/config/env.validation.ts`.
  The process refuses to start on a bad config.
